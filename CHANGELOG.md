## [26.04.02]

### Added

- **Unread tracking via server-side private store, end-to-end.**
  - On entering a chat (`<Chat>` mount / `useChatWrapperInit`) the SDK fetches `chatjson:store` (`getChatsPrivateStoreRequest`) and applies the per-room last-viewed marker. Comparison now uses `msg.id` (server-authoritative microseconds-since-epoch prefix) instead of the client-derived `msg.date` — eliminates drift from `createMessageFromXml`'s `Date.now()` fallback.
  - `flushLastViewedToPrivateStoreStanza` (new helper on `XmppClient`) merges the in-memory last-viewed map into the server's private store in a single round trip. Refuses to overwrite a newer marker so concurrent clients don't trample each other.
  - Trigger points:
    - **App background / inactive** — `AppState.addEventListener('change')` in `XmppProvider` flushes when the app leaves `active`.
    - **Tab change away from the chat** — the testbed flushes when the user moves from the Chat tab to Setup or Logs.
    - **Logout** — `logoutService.performLogout` flushes (rooms with `unreadMessages === 0` plus the active room) before the XMPP socket is closed. Rooms with outstanding unread keep their old marker so they stay unread on the next login.
- **New room hydration default** — `addRoom` now preserves an existing `lastViewedTimestamp` if one is already set; otherwise stamps `Date.now()`. Stops `/chats/my`-hydrated MAM history from being counted as 100% unread on first paint.
- **`instructions.md`** — full RN config guide aligned with the web package docs. Includes a reference `XmppProvider` + `Chat` example, the single-init contract, and a grouped reference for every field in `IConfig`.
- **`patches/expo-document-picker+14.0.8.patch`** + `patch-package` wired into `postinstall` — fixes the iOS 26 DocumentManager.framework SIGABRT on attachment cancel.

### Changed

- **`unreadMiddleware` + `countNewerMessages`** now use `msgSortableMs(msg)` (extracts the 13-digit ms prefix from `msg.id`) instead of `new Date(msg.date).getTime()`. The reducer and the middleware can no longer disagree about the comparison source.
- **`InputContainer` padding** — top `12px` → `8px`, bottom `12px` → `4px`. The send-input row now sits ~8px tighter against the bottom safe-area inset.
- **`RoomList` header / search alignment** — `HeaderRoomList` now uses `paddingHorizontal: 16` and a fixed 40px left/right gutter so the centered title stays optically centered regardless of avatar/menu width. `SearchInput` wrapper margin reset; icon padding trimmed. `chatList` padding aligned to `paddingHorizontal: 16`, matching the header so the avatar column lines up under the search icon.
- **`logoutService.performLogout`** — added the private-store flush step (with a 2-second timeout race so logout never hangs on a stalled stanza).
- **`PickingContext` retention** — `DocumentPickerModule.swift` now appends the delegate to a `retainedDelegates` array on success or cancel and releases it 3 seconds later via `DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter`. Prevents `DOCWeakProxy` from messaging a deallocated target when DocumentManager's XPC delivers a late callback. Removed the spurious "Picking context lost" error log on the second cancel callback (both `documentPickerWasCancelled` and `presentationControllerDidDismiss` fire on swipe-down dismiss — the second one is normal re-entry).

### Fixed

- **App SIGABRT when cancelling the attachment picker.** Crash signature `EXC_CRASH (SIGABRT)` with `-[DOCWeakProxy forwardingTargetForSelector:].cold.1` originating from `DocumentManager.framework`. iOS 26 delivers a late XPC delegate callback after `pickingContext = nil` had already released the swift delegate; the proxy then can't forward and the runtime aborts. See the patch description above.
- **Unread over-count after logout → login.** Previously, the active room's in-memory `lastViewedTimestamp = 0` ("user is viewing here") was never written back to the private store, so the next session re-counted everything since the prior cold start as unread. The new logout flush stamps `Date.now()` for the active room (and any other room with zero unread) before XMPP disconnects.
- **`smallHooks` logout test** — updated to await `performLogout()` and asserts the actual dispatch order (`roomMessages/setLogoutState → roomHeapStore/clearHeap → chat/logout`). The mocked `store` now also exposes a minimal `getState` shape so the new pre-disconnect flush doesn't TypeError.

### Notes

- iOS bundle identifier — verified `com.ethora.chatcomponentrn` in the compiled `Info.plist`. The previous mismatch (`org.name.ethoraChatComponentRN`) was a stale DerivedData product; a clean rebuild emits the correct id from `app.json` + `ios/ethoraChatComponentRN.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`.
- iOS privacy keys — `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription`, `NSCameraUsageDescription`, `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription`, `NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription` confirmed present in the source `Info.plist`. The expo-image-picker plugin in `app.json` keeps them in sync on `expo prebuild`.
